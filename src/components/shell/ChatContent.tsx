              Hi Willâ€”there's an access review that needs your immediate
              attention. I've already completed 60% to save you time, but I still
              need your help with a few final decisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              Let's tackle the rest togetherâ€”it should only take a couple of
              minutes.

              Hi Will, there's an access review for Salesforce that needs your immediate attention. I've already completed 80% to save you time, but I still need your help with a few decisions.
              <br /><br />
              First, regarding the 80% I've already processed: these 80 users are all controllers from the finance department who are actively using their 'Analytics Cloud' role, which you had previously approved. Are you okay with them retaining their access?

              Great, I'll make sure their access is retained. For the remaining 20 users, I need some guidance:
              <br /><br />
              I can see that 10 users were assigned access by John without going through the proper approval process. They're all from the marketing department and aren't even using their access. John didn't provide any business justification at the time. Should we maintain their access?

              I'll reach out to John and get back to you once I hear from him.
              <br /><br />
              I also see 9 accounting clerks from the finance department who never use their access. According to our records, they requested access and you approved it previously. Should we maintain their access going forward?

              Thank you, Will. That's all I needed for now. The auditors will be pleased with our decisions! ðŸ˜‰

              I'll let you know when I hear back from John, and then we can complete this review.
